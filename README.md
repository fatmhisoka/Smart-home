# Smart Home Automation Project README

## Overview
This project is a home automation system designed to enhance security, provide environmental feedback, and monitor temperature within a home environment. It utilizes various sensors, actuators, and an Arduino Uno microcontroller for its operation.

## Components
- PIR Motion Sensor: Detects movement within its specified range.
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): Detects ambient light levels.
- LEDs and Arduino Uno: Conveys information through visual cues.
- Temperature Sensor (LM35): Monitors temperature changes.
- Servo Motor: Controls the movement of the door.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distances for user proximity detection.
